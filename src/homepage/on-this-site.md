## On This Site

I bridge speculative design with pragmatic implementation: from leading community energy projects in Scotland to exhibiting futures work at global institutions. On this site you will find theoretical and speculative design work exploring these themes; alongside applied work that I've done with community organisations.

You can browse a selection of my projects across these domains, or view my full [CV](/connect) for a detailed breakdown of my experience.
