Hello, I’m a researcher and creative based in the Orkney Isles. My work explores the social impacts of emerging digital technologies, focusing on how design and digital technoliges might (or might not!) shape more equitable and sustainable futures.

My practice sits at the intersection of design, data, social research, and speculative futures. I recently graduated with an MSc with Distinction in Data, Inequality and Society from the University of Edinburgh's Edinburgh Futures Institute. This academic focus informs my technical work as the Technical Manager at Community Energy Scotland, where I lead a team developing fair and inclusive community energy projects using digital and energy technologies for social good.

Previously, I spent three years as a Senior Designer at the award-winning studio Superflux, contributing to international exhibitions (including for the Museum of the Future in Dubai and the Venice Biennale of Architecture), films, and cultural works that investigate emerging technologies, climate change futures, and citizen-centered alternatives for the internet.

On this site, you’ll find a selection of the research and practice-based projects I’ve led or taken part in that demonstrate my work across technical, design, and research domains.
