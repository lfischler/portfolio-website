## Hello there!

Hello, I’m a researcher and creative based in the Orkney Isles. My work explores the social impacts of emerging digital technologies, focusing on how design and digital technologies might (or might not!) shape more equitable and sustainable futures.

My practice sits at the intersection of design, data, social research, and speculative futures. I recently graduated with an MSc with Distinction in Data, Inequality and Society from the University of Edinburgh's Edinburgh Futures Institute.

### Role and Experience

This academic focus informs my technical work as the Technical Manager at Community Energy Scotland, where I lead a team developing fair and inclusive community energy projects using digital and energy technologies for social good.

Previously, I spent three years as a Senior Designer at the award-winning studio Superflux, contributing to:

*   International exhibitions (e.g., Museum of the Future in Dubai, Venice Biennale of Architecture)
*   Films
*   Cultural works that investigate emerging technologies, climate change futures, and citizen-centered alternatives for the internet.
