I’m frequently visiting Glasgow, Edinburgh and, occasionally, London. I’m up for a walk and a chat and enjoy meeting interesting folk. If you’re visiting Orkney, then absolutely don’t leave without saying “hello”!
Here is how you can connect with me digitally:

    The best way to contact me is over email.
    You can also find me on Twitter at @leannefischler.
    I’m on LinkedIn at Leanne Fischler.
    As I continue to develop my data skills, you’ll find some of my work under @lfischler on GitHub.
